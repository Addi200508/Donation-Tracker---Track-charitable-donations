# Donation Tracker

## Project Description

Donation Tracker is a blockchain-based smart contract system that enables transparent and efficient tracking of charitable donations. Built on the Core blockchain network, this decentralized application allows users to create donation campaigns, make contributions, and track all donation activities with complete transparency and immutability.

The platform serves as a bridge between donors and charitable causes, ensuring that every donation is recorded on the blockchain and funds are transferred directly to campaign recipients without intermediaries.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize charitable giving by leveraging blockchain technology to create a trustless, transparent, and efficient donation ecosystem. We aim to eliminate the traditional barriers and inefficiencies in charitable donations while providing donors with complete visibility into how their contributions are being used.

By building on the Core blockchain, we ensure low transaction costs and fast processing times, making micro-donations feasible and encouraging more people to participate in charitable giving.
